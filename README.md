# TweetFlow-Automating-Twitter-Data-Pipelines-with-Apache-Airflow
Automate Twitter data extraction, processing, and analysis with 'TweetFlow,' leveraging Apache Airflow. Extract tweets using Tweepy, analyze with pandas, and orchestrate the entire pipeline on AWS for real-time insights
Project: TTweetFlow-Automating-Twitter-Data-Pipelines-with-Apache-Airflow

Overview:
This project demonstrates the development of an automated Twitter data pipeline using Apache Airflow, Tweepy, and pandas. The pipeline extracts tweets from the Twitter API, processes the data, and performs basic analysis. The workflow is orchestrated using Apache Airflow on AWS.

Files:

twitter_dag.py: Defines the Airflow DAG for orchestrating the data pipeline. It schedules and manages the execution of tasks for extracting tweets, transferring data, and performing analysis.
twitter_etl.py: Contains the Python script for extracting tweets from the Twitter API using Tweepy.
README.md: Documentation providing an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.
Setup Instructions:

Install Apache Airflow and required Python libraries (Tweepy, pandas) on your system or cloud instance.
Clone the project repository from GitHub.
Set up Apache Airflow on AWS or your preferred cloud platform.
Place twitter_dag.py and twitter_etl.py in the Airflow DAGs directory.
Configure Airflow to run the DAG on a schedule (e.g., daily).
Ensure that necessary credentials for accessing the Twitter API are configured.
Start the Airflow scheduler and web server.
Usage:

The Airflow DAG (twitter_dag) automatically triggers the execution of tasks according to the specified schedule.
The twitter_etl task extracts tweets from the Twitter API and stores the data in a designated location.
Subsequent tasks can transfer the extracted data to an online server for further analysis.
Analysis scripts utilizing pandas can be executed to derive insights from the tweet data.
